Sarcoidosis: This study (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001207\">phs001207</a>) focuses specifically on the genetics of sarcoidosis, a condition characterized by granuloma formation in multiple organs.<br>3. Congenital Heart Defects: The Pediatric Cardiovascular Genetics Consortium (PCGC) study (phs00...35) aims to define genetic causes for congenital heart defects.<br>4. Atrial Fibrillation: The Atrial Fibrillation Biobank Ludwig Maximilian University (AFLMU) Study (phs00...43) investigates the genetics and -omics factors influencing atrial fibrillation.<br><br>These keywords are likely relevant to cardiovascular disease research in general, but specific studies may focus on different aspects or diseases within this broader category."
